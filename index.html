                <h1>Kudos to Mr Jake</h1>
                <p>Part of our Guilin tour with China includes a beautiful trip down the Guilin River. Our guide Ms
                    Deng
                    was so informative and helpful. She made sure we were on the top deck at the key points on the
                    river. Saw lots of water buffalo and hundreds of bamboo rafts. Great scenery and unforgettable
                    experience.</p>

                <h1>Great Food!!!</h1>
                <p>Jetspeed Agency is one of the best, if not the best, travel agencies I've ever travelled with.
                    Accommodation was top-notch, and the food is simply a highlight of the whole trip. From the crab
                    buffet at Sapporo to the fine dining at Hakodate, it was worth every penny spent. </p>

                <p>I booked a food trip with Jetspeed and I am so glad I did. Our guide, Peter, brought us to all
                    the
                    local dining places where we got to a taste of authentic local food. From the mouth-watering
                    Laksa
                    to the legendary Chilli crab, we had such great fun.</p>

                <h1>Excellent</h1>
                <p>Our guide Yang is so knowledgeable and experienced. He goes out of the way to help us secure the
                    best
                    seats for all the performances, and also took good care of my grandma who was sick on the trip.
                    Thanks, Yang. Look forward to travelling with Jetspeed again.</p>
